        <h2>Lagu Pertama</h2>
        <p><strong>Judul:</strong> Dandelions</p>
        <p><strong>Penyanyi:</strong> Ruth B.</p>
        <p><strong>Lirik:</strong> Maybe it's the way you say my name<br>Maybe it's the way you say my name<br>But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you<br>But it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you<br>And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime<br>But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you<br>'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions<br>Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine<br>And I see forever in your eyes<br>I feel okay when I see you smile, smile<br>Wishing on dandelions all of the time<br>Praying to God that one day you'll be mine<br>Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time<br>I think that you are the one for me<br>
'Cause it gets so hard to breathe<br>
When you're looking at me, I've never felt so alive and free<br>
When you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy<br>
And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime<br>
And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine<br>
'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine<br>
And I see forever in your eyes
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile<br>
Wishing on dandelions all of the time
Praying to God that one day you'll be mine<br>
Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time<br>
Dandelion, into the wind you go<br>
Won't you let my darling know?<br>
Dandelion, into the wind you go<br>
Won't you let my darling know that?<br>
I'm in a field of dandelions<br>
Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine<br>
And I see forever in your eyes<br>
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile<br>
Wishing on dandelions all of the time<br>
Praying to God that one day you'll be mine<br>
Wishing on dandelions all of the time, all of the time<br>
I'm in a field of dandelions<br>
Wishing on every one that you'd be mine, mine<br>

        <h2>Lagu Kedua</h2>
        <p><strong>Judul:</strong> Take A Chance With Me</p>
        <p><strong>Penyanyi:</strong><p>NIKI</p>
        <p><strong>Lirik:</strong>His laugh you'd die for, his laugh you'd die for<br>The kind that colors the sky<br>Heart intangible, slips away faster<br>Than dandelion fluff in the sunlight<br>And he's got swirls of passion in his eyes<br>
Uncovering the dreams he dreams at night<br>
As much and hard as he tries to hide<br>
I can see right through<br>
See right through<br>
His voice you'd melt for, he says my name like<br>
I'd fade away somehow if he's too loud<br>
What I would give for me to get my feet<br>
Back on the ground, head off the clouds<br>
I laugh at how we're polar opposites<br>
I read him like a book and he's a clueless little kid<br>
Doesn't know that I'd stop time and space<br>
Just to make him smile<br>
Make him smile<br>
Oh, why can't we for once<br>
Say what we want, say what we feel?<br>
Oh, why can't you for once<br>
Disregard the world and run to what you know is real?<br>
Take a chance with me<br>
Take a chance with me<br>
Ooh<br>
Ooh<br>
His kiss you'd kill for, just one and you're done for<br>
Electricity surgin' in the air<br>
He drives me crazy, it's so beyond me<br>
How he'd look me dead in the eye and stay unaware<br>
That I'm hopelessly captivated<br>
By a boy who thinks love's overrated<br>
How did I get myself in this arrangement?<br>
It baffles me too, baffles me too<br>
Oh, why can't we for once<br>
Say what we want, say what we feel?<br>
Oh, why can't you for once<br>
Disregard the world and run to what you know is real?<br>
In the end, we only regret<br>
The chances we didn't take<br>
I'll be your safety net<br>
So why not raise the stakes?<br>
I can hear your heart from across the room<br>
Pulsin' through my veins, I know you need this too<br>
Lie to me all you please<br>
I can see right through<br>
See right through<br>
Oh, why can't we for once<br>
Say what we want, say what we feel?<br>
Oh, why can't you for once<br>
Disregard the world and run to what you know is real?<br>
Oh, why can't we for once<br>
Say what we want, say what we feel?<br>
Oh, why can't you for once<br>
Disregard the world and run to what you know is real?<br>
Take a chance with me<br>
Take a chance with me<br>
Ooh<br></p>

        <h2>Lagu Ketiga</h2>
        <p><strong>Judul:</strong> From the Start</p>
        <p><strong>Penyanyi:</strong> Laufey</p>
        <p><strong>Lirik:</strong> Don't you notice how<br>I get quiet when there's no one else around?<br>Me and you and awkward silenceDon't you dare look at me that way<br>
I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same<br>
Oh, the burning pain<br>
Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate<br>
"She's so perfect, " blah, blah, blah<br>
Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day<br>
Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say<br>
That when I talk to you oh, Cupid walks right through<br>
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?<br>
Confess I loved you from the start<br>
What's a girl to do?<br>
Lying on my bed, staring into the bluе<br>
Unrequited, terrifying<br>
Lovе is driving me a bit insane<br>
Have to get this off my chest<br>
I'm telling you today<br>
That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through<br>
And shoots an arrow through my heart<br>
And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?<br>
Confess I loved you from the start<br>
Confess I loved you<br>
Just thinking of you<br>
I know I've loved you from the start<br></p>
