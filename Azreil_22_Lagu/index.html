    The Goo Goo Dolls are an American rock band that formed in Buffalo, New York, in 1986. The band has gone through several lineup changes over the years, but its core members have always been vocalist and guitarist John Rzeznik and bassist and vocalist Robby Takac. The band's name was inspired by an advertisement for a toy called a "Goo Goo Doll."

The Goo Goo Dolls started as a punk rock and post-punk band, releasing their debut album, "Goo Goo Dolls," in 1987. However, their breakthrough came in the early 1990s when they began to shift towards a more mainstream alternative rock sound. Their 1993 album, "Superstar Car Wash," and the single "We Are the Normal," written with and featuring Paul Westerberg of The Replacements, received critical acclaim.
